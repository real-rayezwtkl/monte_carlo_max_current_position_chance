    "Therefore, the chance that Max Verstappen would have reduced the gap by 92 points was calculated to be approximately 18% To put that into perspective, the odds of this happening were approximately 1 in 5.4. This means that in nearly 82 out of every 100 instances modeled under the same performance distribution (mean = 7.25 points and standard deviation approx. = 13.42 points per race), the required gap reduction would not have been achieved. Max Verstappen has overcome massive statistical odds to have one last shot at securing his 5th consecutive WDC"
