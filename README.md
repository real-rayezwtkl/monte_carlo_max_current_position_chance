# Max Verstappen Current Position Probability(After the Qatar GP) using a Monte Carlo Model

Project Summary

This repository houses the code and analysis for a Monte Carlo Simulation project focused on predicting the probability of Max Verstappen overcoming a significant points deficit in the World Drivers' Championship (WDC) within a set timeframe.The primary goal was to quantify the statistical odds of Max Verstappen reducing a 92-point WDC gap by the target race (Qatar Grand Prix).

Key Findings & Methodology

- Modeled Performance Distribution:
     Mean points per race: 7.25
     Standard Deviation of points per race: approx 13.42
  
- Simulated Probability of Success:
     The chance of reducing the 92-point gap was calculated to be approximately 18%.
     This represents odds of approximately 1 in 5.4.

Statistical Implication:In nearly 82% of the modeled instances, the required gap reduction would not have been achieved, demonstrating the massive statistical challenge faced by the driver.

Technologies Used:
- Python
- fastf1 api
- Pandas
- numpy
